Mongoose, node, express and mongodb Demonstration

I used this tool to demo the possible combination for mentioned stack above

I built a notes application with some valications around forms etc.

I used the mongodb online free version offered by mLab. 

I used the Robomongo engine for visual assistance of data that stored in mongodb

I used swig for visual engine for teh project

Expressgenerator has been used instead of express direct

nodemon can be used for server management.

Enjoy !!
